Intro & History on Topic 
**************************

Salsa 

* is a partner dance. 
  
  * One partner will play the role of a lead - usually a male.
    
    * As a lead, your goal is to **offer and guide connection**.

  * The other partner will play the role of a follower - usually a female.
    
    * As a follow, your goal is to **seek and maintain connection**

* It is a latin dance that evolves with the mixed 
  of Taino, african slaves and spanish conquerors. The country that has 
  influence Salsa the most is Cuba. 

There are different type of style of salsa dance.

* Salsa on 1 
* Salsa on 2. - the one practice at MSBD
  

The most distinct form of salsa is Colombian salsa, also known as salsa 
caleña or Cali-style salsa (after the city of Cali, where it is most popular).

At MSBD, I started with a 6 hours bootcamp ($98) of Salsa, then decided to become 
a member for $198 per month.

Tips to Learn Dance 
********************

I think the most goated advices I have received are:

1. Consistency is the key. Even when you don't get it quite yet, keep showing 
   up. Your brain and body will get used to it till it becomes muscle memory.

#. Practice your count and match the counts with the steps. 
   
   * If you have to keep saying ``1..2..3, 5..6..7``, or ``2..3, 6..7`` or 
     ``koom koom, ba ki ki ki, koom koom``
     keep counting in your head, out loud is better.
   * Know which foot to step in, and which count you step the right foot or 
     left foot.

#. Practice with `Salsa Timing with Conga instrument (Alejandro)`_, practice with the count, practice the patterns.
   
   .. seealso:: 
      
      * `Salsa timing, clave 2-3 80 BPM`_ 
      * `How to count beats in Salsa Music`_ 


#. Maintain your frame.


Roadmap for Dancing
**********************

1. Learn to count, keep beat. I.e Practice the timing.
   
   * Usually in dancing, we only step on the count. We don't step on pause (no count).

#. Learn the basics:
   
   1. Forward basic steps 
   2. Back basic steps 
   #. Side basic
   #. Half basic
   #. Partner position:
      
      * Lead: 
        
        * stands, feet slight apart, elbows forward pass your side 
        * Hands and fingers straight like you're about to clap 
        * then middle and ring fingers of each hand bent pointing toward 
          the center of your body 
        
        * Then raise down your forearm and hand frame till they are about your 
          partner's belly button.

   #. Right turn 
   #. Left turn 
   #. cross-body lead
   #. Cross body lead with turn

#. Watch a bunch of videos to train your brain to recognize patterns.
#. Practice Salsa Combo patterns
