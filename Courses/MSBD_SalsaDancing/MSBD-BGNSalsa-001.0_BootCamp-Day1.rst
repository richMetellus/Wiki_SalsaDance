Basic Step
*************

The basic step consist of **forward basic** and **back basic**

.. card:: For the beat/count we have:
   
   Using the conga beat music timing we have:
   
   * ``koom koom`` ``ba`` ``ki ki ki`` then repeat.   

     - i.e ``koom koom`` ``ba`` ``ki ki ki``, ``koom koom`` ``ba`` ``ki ki ki``   
   

   * or  we have ``right`` on (koom koom) as a pause, then quick, quick slow i.e 
     ``left`` ``right`` ``left`` with pause on koom koom   

   * or ``koom koom``, ``quick quick slow``, ``quick quick slow`` where slow is koom koom 
     as a pause.

With **forward basic**, 

1. we start with the **right foot** going slightly foward on the **koom koom** beat.
#. Then **left foot** as big step going foward on **ba** beat as a mean to put 
   all our weight on left foot, so the next leg (right foot) is free
 
   * we always lead with our chest foward.

#. then we step with the **right foot in place** on first ``ki`` beat 
#. then we lift our left leg quick so that on the ``ki ki``  beat such that 
   by the time the beat is ``koom koom`` our left foot is slightly next to our 
   right foot => this step mark the beginning of our **back basic**


With **Back basic** 

1. We start with the **left foot** going slightly backward on **koom koom** beat 
#. Then **right foot** as a big step go back on the ``ba`` beat.
#. Then we step with the **left foot** in **place** on the ``ki`` beat 
#. Then we lift the **right foot** going up and forward toward on ``ki ki`` so 
   the foot land either slightly forward  past the left foot or on very close 
   proximity to the left foot on ``koom koom`` timing.

.. note:: Throughout all these steps, make sure to keep our chest forward, and 
   lead forward with our body.
